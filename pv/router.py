        # Routing behaves as an integrator, for stability.

        # Solis S5 EH1P has several different behaviors to which we should adapt for better routing.
        #
        # 1) Feedback loop inoperative, PV controls the output
        #   Full export: (meter_export > 0) AND (Battery is full, battery_max_charge_current = 0)
        #   The inverver is exporting everything it can. Routing power will change meter_export but the inverter 
        #   won't react to that unless we draw too much, causing meter_export to become negative, at this point 
        #   it will retake control and draw power from the battery, exiting this mode.
        #   -> The router is actually in control of everything
        #   -> We can route as fast as possible, but keep meter_export > 0
        #
        # 1a) EPM Export power limit (per inverter setting)
        #   Feedback loop operating. Inverter controls export power.
        #   In this mode, the feedback loop is very quick: it reads the meter once per second and reacts almost
        #   immediately, taking more power from PV if available.
        #   -> Again, route as fast as possible, taking into account the inverter will react one second later.
        #   
        # 2) Inverter grid port is maxed out
        #   The inverter gets more power from PV than its grid port can export. This power can be used to charge 
        #   the battery, if needed. This mode is relevant for routing because while it would appear we can steal
        #   power from the battery (because we see it is charging), in reality we can't because the inverter 
        #   can't output more power on the grid port. So any extra load being switched on would draw from the grid.
        #   -> Detect this and avoid this mistake
        #   -> Inverter is maxed out, so the router is actually in control of everything
        #
        # 3) Battery DC-DC is operating
        #     Unless the battery DC-DC is maxed out, this corresponds to meter_export being near zero.
        #     When the inverter is working with the battery (doesn't matter if charging or discharging) the control 
        #   loop becomes much slower. A few seconds delay is inserted into the loop.
