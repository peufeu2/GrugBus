pv/solis1/          Inverter 1
pv/solis1/meter     Meter attached to inverter1 (because its internal grid port power measurement sucks too much)
pv/meter/           Meter for the whole house

#####   Sign of power
When power can flow one way, always positive (example: PV power)
When Power can flow both ways, positive sign is always consumed power
  If something_power is positive, that something is drawing power or current
  If something_power is negative, that something is producing power
This is sometimes not intuitive, but at least it's the same convention everywhere!
    Inverter grid port power 
        positive if it is consuming power (to charge batteries for example)
        negative means it's producing
    Battery power is positive if it is charging
    Backup port power is power consumed by backup loads, always positive
    Grid side meter is positive if the house is consuming power
    etc

        # Routing behaves as an integrator, for stability.

        # Solis S5 EH1P has several different behaviors to which we should adapt for better routing.
        #
        # 1) Feedback loop inoperative, PV controls the output
        #   Full export: (meter_export > 0) AND (Battery is full, battery_max_charge_current = 0)
        #   The inverver is exporting everything it can. Routing power will change meter_export but the inverter 
        #   won't react to that unless we draw too much, causing meter_export to become negative, at this point 
        #   it will retake control and draw power from the battery, exiting this mode.
        #   -> The router is actually in control of everything
        #   -> We can route as fast as possible, but keep meter_export > 0
        #
        # 1a) EPM Export power limit (per inverter setting)
        #   Feedback loop operating. Inverter controls export power.
        #   In this mode, the feedback loop is very quick: it reads the meter once per second and reacts almost
        #   immediately, taking more power from PV if available.
        #   -> Again, route as fast as possible, taking into account the inverter will react one second later.
        #   
        # 2) Inverter grid port is maxed out
        #   The inverter gets more power from PV than its grid port can export. This power can be used to charge 
        #   the battery, if needed. This mode is relevant for routing because while it would appear we can steal
        #   power from the battery (because we see it is charging), in reality we can't because the inverter 
        #   can't output more power on the grid port. So any extra load being switched on would draw from the grid.
        #   -> Detect this and avoid this mistake
        #   -> Inverter is maxed out, so the router is actually in control of everything
        #
        # 3) Battery DC-DC is operating
        #     Unless the battery DC-DC is maxed out, this corresponds to meter_export being near zero.
        #     When the inverter is working with the battery (doesn't matter if charging or discharging) the control 
        #   loop becomes much slower. A few seconds delay is inserted into the loop.
